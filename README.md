Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/zxgaqw.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.

Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.

Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:

User Story: As a user, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

Bonus User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

Bonus User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
